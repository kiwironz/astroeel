# LoRaWAN Mailbox Monitor

## The Challenge

Living on a rural property with the mailbox 500 meters down a long driveway meant daily walks to check for mail delivery - often finding nothing. The homeowner wanted an automated solution that would notify them when mail actually arrived, without the expense and complexity of running power or internet cables to the remote location.

## Technical Approach

The solution uses LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology, which can transmit small amounts of data over distances of several kilometers using very little power. The device uses a simple but clever approach:

### Ultra-Low Power Design
- Reed switch sensor consumes zero power until activated
- Microcontroller sleeps in deep power-down mode
- Only wakes up when mailbox door opens (magnet moves away from reed switch)
- Transmits notification packet and returns to sleep
- Achieves 2+ years battery life from a single lithium cell

### LoRaWAN Communication
- Connects to a LoRaWAN gateway up to 15km away
- Gateway forwards message to cloud service
- Cloud service triggers email notification
- Alexa skill announces "you have mailbox" through smart speakers

### Retrofit Installation
- 3D printed mounting brackets fit most standard mailboxes
- Magnetic reed switch mounts inside mailbox
- Magnet attaches to door with strong adhesive
- No modifications to mailbox structure required
- Weather-resistant enclosure protects electronics

## Technical Specifications

**Hardware:**
- STM32L0 ultra-low-power microcontroller
- LoRaWAN radio module (SX1276)
- Magnetic reed switch sensor
- 3.6V/2400mAh Lithium primary battery
- Custom PCB design optimized for power efficiency

**Software:**
- Embedded C firmware
- LoRaWAN stack implementation
- Deep sleep power management
- Cloud-based notification service
- Alexa Skills Kit integration

**Mechanical:**
- Weather-resistant ABS enclosure
- 3D printed mounting hardware
- IP65 protection rating
- UV-resistant materials for outdoor use

## Real-World Performance

The device has been operating continuously for over 18 months with the original battery still showing >80% charge. It successfully notifies within 30 seconds of mail delivery and has achieved 100% reliability in all weather conditions including heavy rain, snow, and temperatures from -15°C to +45°C.

The LoRaWAN coverage extends well beyond the required 500m, with successful transmissions recorded at distances over 5km during testing.

## Unique Benefits

- **Zero false positives:** Only triggers when door actually opens
- **Immediate notifications:** Email and voice alerts within 30 seconds
- **Maintenance-free:** Multi-year battery life
- **Weather-proof:** Operates in all conditions
- **Retrofit friendly:** No mailbox modifications needed
- **Long range:** Works at distances impossible for WiFi or Bluetooth

This project demonstrates how modern IoT technology can solve simple everyday problems with elegant, low-power solutions that provide years of reliable operation.
