The first flush contains dust, bird droppings, leaves, and other contaminants that accumulate on the roof between rain events. Manual systems require someone to be present when rain starts - not practical for most households.\n\n## System Design\n\n### Intelligent Rain Detection\nThe system continuously monitors for rainfall using a sensitive rain sensor. When precipitation is detected, it starts a timer to measure the duration of rainfall. Based on roof area and expected contamination levels, it calculates when sufficient first flush has occurred.\n\n### Automated Valve Control\n- **Initial State:** Motorized ball valve directs all water to waste drain\n- **First Flush Period:** System runs for predetermined time (typically 5-15 minutes depending on roof size)\n- **Clean Water Collection:** After first flush period, valve automatically switches to direct water to storage tanks\n- **End of Rain:** System resets for next rainfall event\n\n### Manual Override Capability\nPhysical control panel allows manual operation for maintenance or testing. LED indicators show system status:\n- Red: First flush diversion active\n- Green: Clean water collection active\n- Yellow: Manual override engaged\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n**Controller:**\n- Arduino Uno microcontroller\n- Custom PCB shield for connections\n- Real-time clock for timing functions\n- Non-volatile memory to store settings\n\n**Actuator System:**\n- NEMA 23 stepper motor for precise valve control\n- 1:10 reduction gearbox for high torque\n- Limit switches for valve position confirmation\n- Weather-protected motor housing\n\n**Sensors:**\n- Capacitive rain sensor for reliable detection\n- Reed switches for valve position feedback\n- Temperature compensation for seasonal variation\n\n## Smart Features\n\n### Adaptive Timing\nThe system learns from local conditions:\n- Longer dry periods require extended first flush time\n- Heavy initial downpours may need shorter diversion\n- Temperature affects contamination levels\n\n### Fail-Safe Operation\n- Power failure defaults to waste diversion (safe mode)\n- Battery backup maintains operation during outages\n- Manual valve handle allows emergency operation\n- Overfill protection prevents tank overflow\n\n### Maintenance Alerts\n- LED indicator warns when valve maintenance due\n- Hour meter tracks system operation\n- Service reminder after preset number of cycles\n\n## Installation Considerations\n\nThe system installs at the transition point between downpipe and storage tank inlet. A Y-junction directs flow either to waste or storage based on valve position. The control box mounts nearby with weatherproof cable connections.\n\n**Typical Installation:**\n1. Install Y-junction in existing downpipe\n2. Mount motorized valve on junction\n3. Install control box within 5m of valve\n4. Connect power supply and sensors\n5. Configure timing parameters for local conditions\n\n## Performance Results\n\nOperating for two full seasons, the system has successfully diverted first flush water from over 50 rainfall events. Water quality testing shows significantly reduced contamination levels in collected water compared to non-diverted samples.\n\n**Measured Benefits:**\n- 85% reduction in particulate contamination\n- 70% reduction in bacterial count\n- Automated operation - no manual intervention required\n- 99.8% reliability over 18 months operation\n\nThe system pays for itself through improved water quality and elimination of manual monitoring during rainfall events.","src/content/projects/first-flush/index.md","513305d904228d10",{"html":123,"metadata":124},"\u003Ch1 id=\"automated-first-flush-water-diverter\">Automated First Flush Water Diverter\u003C/h1>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-problem\">The Problem\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Rainwater harvesting requires diverting the first flush of water from roof surfaces before collecting clean water for storage.
