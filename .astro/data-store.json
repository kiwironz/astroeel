The homeowner wanted an automated solution that would notify them when mail actually arrived, without the expense and complexity of running power or internet cables to the remote location.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\nThe solution uses LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology, which can transmit small amounts of data over distances of several kilometers using very little power. The device uses a simple but clever approach:\n\n### Ultra-Low Power Design\n- Reed switch sensor consumes zero power until activated\n- Microcontroller sleeps in deep power-down mode\n- Only wakes up when mailbox door opens (magnet moves away from reed switch)\n- Transmits notification packet and returns to sleep\n- Achieves 2+ years battery life from a single lithium cell\n\n### LoRaWAN Communication\n- Connects to a LoRaWAN gateway up to 15km away\n- Gateway forwards message to cloud service\n- Cloud service triggers email notification\n- Alexa skill announces \"you have mailbox\" through smart speakers\n\n### Retrofit Installation\n- 3D printed mounting brackets fit most standard mailboxes\n- Magnetic reed switch mounts inside mailbox\n- Magnet attaches to door with strong adhesive\n- No modifications to mailbox structure required\n- Weather-resistant enclosure protects electronics\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\n**Hardware:**\n- STM32L0 ultra-low-power microcontroller\n- LoRaWAN radio module (SX1276)\n- Magnetic reed switch sensor\n- 3.6V/2400mAh Lithium primary battery\n- Custom PCB design optimized for power efficiency\n\n**Software:**\n- Embedded C firmware\n- LoRaWAN stack implementation\n- Deep sleep power management\n- Cloud-based notification service\n- Alexa Skills Kit integration\n\n**Mechanical:**\n- Weather-resistant ABS enclosure\n- 3D printed mounting hardware\n- IP65 protection rating\n- UV-resistant materials for outdoor use\n\n## Real-World Performance\n\nThe device has been operating continuously for over 18 months with the original battery still showing >80% charge. It successfully notifies within 30 seconds of mail delivery and has achieved 100% reliability in all weather conditions including heavy rain, snow, and temperatures from -15°C to +45°C.\n\nThe LoRaWAN coverage extends well beyond the required 500m, with successful transmissions recorded at distances over 5km during testing.\n\n## Unique Benefits\n\n- **Zero false positives:** Only triggers when door actually opens\n- **Immediate notifications:** Email and voice alerts within 30 seconds\n- **Maintenance-free:** Multi-year battery life\n- **Weather-proof:** Operates in all conditions\n- **Retrofit friendly:** No mailbox modifications needed\n- **Long range:** Works at distances impossible for WiFi or Bluetooth\n\nThis project demonstrates how modern IoT technology can solve simple everyday problems with elegant, low-power solutions that provide years of reliable operation.","src/content/projects/mailbox-monitor/index.md","8852d2e4b92597eb",{"html":49,"metadata":50},"\u003Ch1 id=\"lorawan-mailbox-monitor\">LoRaWAN Mailbox Monitor\u003C/h1>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-challenge\">The Challenge\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Living on a rural property with the mailbox 500 meters down a long driveway meant daily walks to check for mail delivery - often finding nothing.
